* Add report button below recipe unless it's yours
* Creating option to remove vote if click on already selected vote (add new route, fetch function, etc.)

* FIX: bug showing 00h01m duration on recipe show but not on editing
* FIX: handle not logged-in on voting click (fetch)

* IMPROVEMENT: make a front-end live update when voting, so that you don't wait for fetch response to show a pseudo-newCount & selected class switch
