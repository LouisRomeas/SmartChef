  about: "The concept of the SmartChef project started to take seed as I was looking for an idea for my end-of-year project at the [3W Academy](//3wa.fr)'s [Full Stack Developer training course](//francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/34393/).

  The idea then came to my girlfriend's and my minds, of a cooking recipes website which ensures that only the recipes of which one possess the ingredients are brought forward.
  
  Of course, I looked up info on this subject and quickly found out that multiple websites already did just that. However, nothing kept me from creating my own take at this concept. So this is what i decided to do."
